R scripts for geospatial analysis about sustainable and equitable transport and parking policy in San Jose, CA
For capstone project at Santa Clara University
We used these r scripts for our statistical and geospatial analysis

Background info:
Policies related to parking and transportation impact environmental quality, social equity, and economic opportunity through many different pathways. This report seeks to strengthen equity and environmental justice for the Roosevelt Park/Five Wounds (referred to either as “Roosevelt Park/Five Wounds” or “Roosevelt Park” throughout the report) and Spartan-Keyes (referred to either as “Spartan-Keyes” or “Spartan Keyes”) neighborhoods in San Jose, California through an analysis of such policies. One example of the impacts of these policies includes health problems related to traffic pollution, which can range from asthma to heart attacks (American Lung Association [ALA], 2021). Another example is the increased likelihood of living near major roadways for members of communities that include racial and ethnic minorities, migrants, and non-English speakers when compared to members of other communities, as determined by Boehmer et al. (2013) in their study of traffic-related air pollution. Due to their proximity to busy roadways, it is worth investigating how the communities living within our focus neighborhoods are being impacted and how municipal policy can improve equity and environmental justice for these communities.

Boundaries of Roosevelt Park/Five Wounds and Spartan-Keyes Neighborhoods and Their Proximity to Major Freeways
This report is organized around a sustainability framework that considers equity, defined here as “the state, quality or ideal of being just, impartial and fair” (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2020); environmental sustainability; and economic well-being for all. In addition, our research utilizes an environmental justice framework in order to acknowledge how lower-income communities or communities of color are potentially uniquely impacted by parking and transportation policies. This report includes Five Wounds and several other smaller areas that may informally (e.g. on Google Maps) be considered separate from Roosevelt Park, as part of Roosevelt Park, per the official delineation by the City Council of San Jose.

Our Research Questions, guiding our research and analysis, are:
How do key transportation demand management (TDM) strategies—such as public transportation, transit subsidies, and rideshare programs— affect low-income residents’ travel behavior and economic outcomes?
How do parking policies affect low-income residents in terms of access to jobs, housing affordability, and other economic costs?
Based on the findings of the first two research questions, how can the City of San Jose more equitably address parking and transportation management through public policies in the Roosevelt Park/Five Wounds and Spartan-Keyes neighborhoods?
